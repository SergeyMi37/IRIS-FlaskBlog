# IRIS-FlaskBlog
Realworld  Application using Flask, SQLAlchemy, and InterSystems IRIS

![main](https://github.com/mwaseem75/IRIS-FlaskBlog/assets/18219467/9cd462a5-920f-4d0d-9c8f-604468ca8244)

The goal of this project is to create a real-world application that leverages the Flask web framework, SQLAlchemy ORM, and the InterSystems IRIS database. The application should be designed to solve a specific problem or address a practical use case.

Technologies to Use:
Flask: A micro web framework for Python that allows you to build web applications quickly and efficiently.Conduit
SQLAlchemy: An Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library that provides a high-level, Pythonic interface for interacting with databases.
InterSystems IRIS: A high-performance, data platform that combines a powerful database with integration, analytics, and AI capabilities.

Functional Requirements:
User Registration and Authentication:
Users should be able to create accounts and log in securely using passwords.
Implement authentication using Flask's built-in authentication system or popular extensions like Flask-Login.
Provide password hashing and encryption to ensure security.
User Profile Management:
Users should be able to view and edit their profiles.
Profiles should include basic information like name, email, and optional profile picture.
Data Storage and Management:
Utilize InterSystems IRIS as the database for storing application data.
Define SQLAlchemy models to represent the necessary data structures and entities.
The application should support CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for relevant data entities.
User Interface:
Design a clean and user-friendly interface for the application using HTML, CSS, and potentially JavaScript.
Consider using a front-end framework like Bootstrap to enhance the UI.
RESTful API:
Design and implement a RESTful API to allow external applications to interact with your application's data and features.
Testing:
Write unit tests for critical parts of the application, including API endpoints and data manipulation.
Use popular testing frameworks like pytest.
Run tests on API with newman
Non-Functional Requirements:
Documentation:
Provide clear and concise documentation explaining how to set up, configure, and use the application.
Version Control:
Use version control (e.g., Git) to track changes and collaborate with team members.
Code Quality:
Write clean, modular, and maintainable code following PEP 8 guidelines.


Remember that the scope of this project may vary based on your requirements and available resources. Break down the project into manageable tasks and milestones for easier development and tracking. Additionally, consider seeking guidance from experienced developers or mentors, especially if you are new to any of the technologies involved.

Deliverables:
The application will be available on OEX.
	Documentation, DC article, readme.md and wiki for technical details.
	Video tutorial with application demo and comments about its features.
